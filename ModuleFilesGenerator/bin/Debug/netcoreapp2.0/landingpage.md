# PnP PowerShell overview

SharePoint Patterns and Practices (PnP) contains a library of PowerShell commands (PnP PowerShell) that allows you to perform complex provisioning and artifact management actions towards SharePoint. The commands use CSOM and can work against both SharePoint Online as SharePoint On-Premises.

_**Applies to:** SharePoint Online | SharePoint 2016 | SharePoint 2013_

## Installation #

There are 3 ways to install the cmdlets. We recommend, where possible, to install them from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com). Alternatively you can download the setup files or run a PowerShell script to download the PowerShellGet module and install the cmdlets subsequently.

### PowerShell Gallery ###
If you main OS is Windows 10, or if you have [PowerShellGet](https://github.com/powershell/powershellget) installed, you can run the following commands to install the PowerShell cmdlets:

|**SharePoint Version**|**Command to install**|
|------------------|------------------|
|SharePoint Online|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline ```|
|SharePoint 2016|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell2016```|
|SharePoint 2013|```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell2013```|

*Notice*: if you install the latest PowerShellGet from Github, you might receive an error message stating 
>PackageManagement\Install-Package : The version 'x.x.x.x' of the module 'SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline' being installed is not catalog signed.

In order to install the cmdlets when you get this error specify the -SkipPublisherCheck switch with the Install-Module cmdlet, e.g. ```Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline -SkipPublisherCheck -AllowClobber```

### Setup files ##
You can download setup files from the [releases](https://github.com/officedev/pnp-powershell/releases) section of the PnP PowerShell repository. These files will up be updated on a monthly basis. Run the install and restart any open instances of PowerShell to use the cmdlets.

### Installation script ##
This is an alternative for installation on machines that have at least PowerShell v3 installed. You can find the version of PowerShell  by opening PowerShell and running ```$PSVersionTable.PSVersion```. The value for ```Major``` should be above 3.

To install the cmdlets you can run the below command which will install PowerShell Package Management and then install the PowerShell Modules from the PowerShell Gallery.

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/PnP-PowerShell/master/Samples/Modules.Install/Install-SharePointPnPPowerShell.ps1')
```

## Updating ##
Every month a new release will be made available of the PnP PowerShell Cmdlets. If you earlier installed the cmdlets using the setup file, simply download the [latest version](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/releases/latest) and run the setup. This will update your existing installation.

If you have installed the cmdlets using PowerShellGet with ```Install-Module``` from the PowerShell Gallery then you will be able to use the following command to install the latest updated version:

```powershell
Update-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell*
``` 

This will automatically load the module after starting PowerShell 3.0.

You can check the installed PnP-PowerShell versions with the following command:

```powershell
Get-Module SharePointPnPPowerShell* -ListAvailable | Select-Object Name,Version | Sort-Object Version -Descending
```

## Getting Started #
